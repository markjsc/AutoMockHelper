If you use Dependency Injection (DI) in your applications and [Moq](https://github.com/moq/moq) to help with your Unit Tests, this project will help you write unit tests faster.

## Assumptions

This project currently targets [.NET Standard 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard) (which includes .NET Framework 4.6.1 and .NET Core 2.0, among others).

This project assumes the use of [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) along with [Moq](https://github.com/moq/moq) and [Moq's AutoMocker](https://github.com/moq/Moq.AutoMocker).

AutoMockHelper supports MSTest, NUnit, and xUnit.

## Getting Started

- Add the [AutoMockHelper Nuget Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AutoMockHelper/) to your test project.
- Create a test class and inherit from AutoMockContext, using the type of the class under test for the generic parameter:

```c#
public class OrderProcessorTests : AutoMockContext<OrderProcessor>
```

- Use `this.ClassUnderTest` to access an initialized instance of your class under test.
- Use `MockFor<YourInterfaceOrConcreteClass>()` to access mock objects (no need to manually create them with `new Mock<YourInterfaceOrConcreteClass>()`).
- Never worry about manually creating mocks for all of the dependencies in the tested class again!

## Why do I need this

The most common way to create an instance of a class in a Unit Test is to call the constructor and provide either concrete or mocked instances of the necessary dependencies.

Here's an example of how to create an instance of the sample [Order Processor](./AutoMockHelper.Samples.Logic/OrderProcessor/OrderProcessor.cs) inside a unit test:

```c#
//Inside a Unit Test method that exercises some aspect of the OrderProcessor

//Arrange
//Create mock/fake or test double for each dependency
//Configure mock objects with any needed setups/returns/etc.
var mockNotificationService = new Mock<INotificationService>();
mockNotificationService.Setup(x => x.NotifyCustomerOfFailedOrder(testCustomer.CustomerId, NewOrderNumber));
var mockInventoryService = new Mock<InventoryService>();
var mockOrderRepository = new Mock<IOrderRepository>();
var testOrderNumberGeneratorService = new TestOrderNumberGeneratorService();
var logger = new Mock<ILogger>();
logger.Setup(x => x.Info(It.Is<string>(m => m.Contains($"{nameof(OrderProcessor.CreateNewOrder)}"))));

//Create instance of class to test, passing in all of the required dependency
var orderProcessor = new OrderProcessor(mockNotificationService.Object,
                                        mockInventoryService.Object,
                                        mockOrderRepository.Object,
                                        testOrderNumberGeneratorService,
                                        logger.Object);

//Act
//...
//Assert
//...
```

That's not so bad, right? But what happens when you introduce a new dependency to `OrderProcessor` by adding a new parameter to its constructor? **All of the Unit Tests that create an instance of OrderProcessor will fail to compile!**

Another potential issue is the repetition of code involved in creating the necessary mocked dependencies. Sure, you could abstract this logic into helper methods. But there's still a degree of unnecessary duplication and a risk that changing the source object will break the unit tests.

## Show me a better way

Glad you asked! This project aims to solve the problems mentioned above, combined with the goodness of [Moq's AutoMocker](https://github.com/moq/Moq.AutoMocker).

Here's an example that includes the same `OrderProcessor` class from above, except using `AutoMockContext` as the base class (assuming we're testing `OrderProcessor`):

```c#
//This example uses MSTest, but it also works with NUnit and xUnit.
//Simply inherit from the AutoMockContext base class, specifying the type that is under test.
//This assumes that your tests are structured with one test class per class tested.

[TestClass]
public class OrderProcessorTests : AutoMockContext<OrderProcessor>
{
    [TestMethod]
    public async Task CreateNewOrderLogsException()
    {
        //Arrange
        this.MockFor<ILogger>()
            .Setup(x => x.Error(It.Is<string>(m => m.Contains($"{nameof(OrderProcessor.CreateNewOrder)}")), It.IsAny<Exception>()));

        this.MockFor<IOrderRepository>()
            .Setup(x => x.SaveNewOrderAsync(It.IsAny<int>(), It.IsAny<List<OrderItem>>(), It.IsAny<Customer>()))
            .Throws(new ApplicationException("Order Repository is broken!"));

        //Act
        //Use the ClassUnderTest property to access an instance of the class under test.
        //All dependencies are automatically supplied by AutoMocker; Mocks with specified
        // behaviors (such as those configured in the lines above) are automatically used.
        await this.ClassUnderTest.CreateNewOrder(It.IsAny<List<OrderItem>>(), It.IsAny<Customer>());

        //Assert
        this.VerifyAll();
    }
}
```

## What else can AutoMockHelper do

The available members exposed by AutoMockContext are:

- **AutoMocker** - an initialized instance of AutoMocker that can be used to directly access any of the AutoMocker functionality.
- **ClassUnderTest** - an instance of the class specified as the generic type parameter of the test class (i.e. AutoMockContext&lt;YourClassUnderTest&gt;)
- **CreateInstance&lt;TAnyClass&gt;()** - Creates an instance of the specified type, providing the registered test doubles or mocks for all dependencies
- **MockFor&lt;TAnyInterfaceOrClass&gt;()** - Creates, registers, and returns a mock instance of the provided interface or class using the default behavior (Loose - never throws exceptions, returning default values when necessary)
- **StrictMock&lt;TAnyInterfaceOrClass&gt;()** - Creates, registers and returns a mock instance of the provided interface or class using Strict behavior (causes the mock to always throw an exception for invocations that don't have a corresponding setup)
- **Use&lt;&gt;()** (multiple overloads) - Registers and returns an instance of the provided type
- **VerifyAll()** - Calls VerifyAll() for all registered mocks
- **VerifyCallsFor&lt;TMock&gt;()** - Calls VerifyAll() for the specified mock
- **Verify&lt;TMock&gt;()** - Calls Verify() for the specified mock, taking an expression and Times as parameters

## Included Resources

The following projects are included:

- **AutoMockHelper.Core** - This includes the AutoMockContext class and is really the only resource you need in order to implement the Auto Mock Helper.
- **AutoMockHelper.Samples.Logic** - This includes an example of an Order Processing class that is used to demonstrate how AutoMockContext can be applied.
- **AutoMockHelper.Samples.MSTest** - This includes sample unit tests that exercise the OrderProcessing class using the MSTest framework.
- **AutoMockHelper.Samples.NUnit** - This includes sample unit tests that exercise the OrderProcessing class using the NUnit framework.
- **AutoMockHelper.Samples.xUnit** - This includes sample unit tests that exercise the OrderProcessing class using the xUnit framework.

## Notes

- This only supports resolving dependencies that are supplied as Constructor parameters. Although many DI frameworks support Dependency properties, this is not a recommended practice. Also, adding support for Dependency properties would require a reference to the specific DI framework, making this project less generic.

## Next Steps

- Incorporate some of the newer features of AutoMocker
- Add improvements and fixes, as needed
